#Blastoff!

Before Chrome started autogenerating homepages for users, you were stuck with using [the googs](https://www.google.com) or `about:blank`. Well, I say, fuck that.

This coad allows you to easily customize a list of links for you to use as your browser's homepage. Your blastoff homepage is password-protected and stored as a JSON file, so no database is necessary.

## Installation

Install on a working PHP server. Should work right out the box.

## Todo

Haven't touched this since I wrote it years ago. Could use some cleanup.
* Get dependency management running - likely under Composer - so that we don't have to include a bunch of jQuery assets in the repo
* Better autoloading
* JS Refactor
